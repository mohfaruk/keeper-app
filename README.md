## Note Keeper App

A simple React CRUD application which allows users to create notes for display. As is the case with CRUD apps, they are also able to read, update and delete notes. This project was an opportunity to practice React Hooks.

## Lessons Learned

This was my first React project (after making the obligatory to-do list.), and despite it’s simplicity, I am rather proud of it. The project allowed me to play around with Hooks (only useState), which I found to be fast, efficient and readable due to its succinct code.

I begun to diverge away from class based components and into functional components. I found this to be a seamless transition from my existing JavaScript knowledge. Removing the hassle of binding the this keyword made functional components a clear favourite for me. I intend on using them in future React projects.

Additionally, I put my practise of array methods (map, filter) to good use. I really appreciate their usefulness and understand why they are commonly used within React apps.

Although I got the update feature to work, I’m not content with the design and how it operates. Having to click another button to allow users to make changes is an outdated mechanic, and some users may not be aware that you would have to press enter to submit changes. Moreover, there is no option to amend the notes title. I am keen on making the feature more fluid and efficient. This would be done by allowing users to update notes by simply clicking a notes text area.

## Future Updates

• Improving the update feature, when a note is clicked on, it automatically allows users to amend the note. This would prevent them from having to click the update button to do this.

• Include local storage so that every time the page is refreshed, the previous notes are not lost.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
